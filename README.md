# 🌐 Personal Website

## Overview

This project was built as part of a Scrimba course when I was just starting to learn how to code. I named it **Personal Website**, but it doesn't actually contain any personal information about me. The reason for this name is simply because that's what the project was called during the course.

🔧 **Technologies Used**:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
